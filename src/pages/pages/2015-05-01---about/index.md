I started out in web development creating websites for small businesses. Now I build custom web apps with Node, React, MySQL and Docker. GraphQL is very interesting and should find it's way into my work in the near future. I like these tools for their speed of development and thriving ecosystems.

I have a B.S. in Applied Computing Technology from Colorado State University. Individual practice and self paced learning has been a game changer for my career. I let real challenges I encounter at work guide my curriculum. I also like to use text books and coding challenges to grow my skillset. Recently I've been diving into Robert C. Martin's Clean Code Series, and it has been awesome.
